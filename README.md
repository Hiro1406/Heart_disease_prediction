Heart Disease Prediction
Project Overview
This project focuses on predicting the likelihood of heart disease in patients based on clinical data. By leveraging machine learning, the goal is to provide a reliable screening tool that assists healthcare professionals in identifying high-risk individuals early.

Key Features

End-to-End Pipeline: Covers the full data lifecycle from cleaning and feature engineering to model evaluation.
High Accuracy: Optimized model performance to achieve an 89% accuracy rate.
Interactive Dashboard: A built-in Streamlit application allows users to input patient data and visualize risk factors in real-time.
Model Interpretability: Visualized performance metrics and feature importance to ensure the model's decisions are transparent and understandable.

Technical Stack

Languages: Python.
Libraries: Scikit-Learn, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn.
Deployment: Streamlit.

Methodology

Data Preprocessing: Handled missing values, encoded categorical variables, and performed feature scaling.
Model Training: Evaluated various classification algorithms to find the most robust solution.
Hyperparameter Tuning: Refined the final model to maximize predictive power.
Evaluation: Used metrics like accuracy and visualization tools to validate performance.

Results
The final model achieved an 89% accuracy score, demonstrating a strong ability to distinguish between healthy patients and those at risk.
